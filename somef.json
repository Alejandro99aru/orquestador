    "excerpt": "Contributing to Captum\nThank you for your interest in contributing to Captum! We want to make contributing to Captum as easy and transparent as possible.\nBefore you begin writing code, it is important that you share your intention to contribute with the team, based on the type of contribution:\n\n\nYou want to propose and implement a new algorithm, add a new feature or fix a bug. This can be both code and documentation proposals.\n\nFor all non-outstanding features, bug-fixes and algorithms in the Captum issue list (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues) please create an issue first.\nIf the implementation requires API or any other major code changes (new files, packages or algorithms), we will likely request a design document to review and discuss the design and implementation before making changes. An example design document for LIME can be found here (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues/467).\nOnce we agree that the plan looks good or confirmed that the change is small enough to not require a detailed design discussion, go ahead and implement it!\n\n\n\nYou want to implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue.\n\nSearch for your issue in the Captum issue list (https://github.com/pytorch/captum/issues).\nPick an issue and comment that you'd like to work on the feature or bug-fix.\nIf you need more context on a particular issue, please ask and we\u2019ll be happy to help.\n\n\n\nOnce you implement and test your feature or bug-fix, please submit a Pull Request to https://github.com/pytorch/captum (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).\nThis document covers some of the techical aspects of contributing to Captum. More details on what we are looking for in the contributions can be found in the Contributing Guidelines.\nDevelopment installation\nTo get the development installation with all the necessary dependencies for\nlinting, testing, and building the documentation, run the following:\nbash\ngit clone https://github.com/pytorch/captum.git\ncd captum\npip install -e .[dev]\nOur Development Process\nCode Style\nCaptum uses ufmt and  flake8 to\nenforce a common code style across the code base. ufmt and flake8 are installed easily via\npip using pip install ufmt flake8, and run locally by calling\nbash\nufmt format .\nflake8 .\nfrom the repository root.\nWe feel strongly that having a consistent code style is extremely important, so\nCircleCI will fail on your PR if it does not adhere to the ufmt or flake8 formatting style.\nType Hints\nCaptum is fully typed using python 3.6+\ntype hints.\nWe expect any contributions to also use proper type annotations, and we enforce\nconsistency of these in our continuous integration tests.\nTo type check your code locally, install mypy,\nwhich can be done with pip using pip install \"mypy&gt;=0.760\"\nThen run this script from the repository root:\nbash\n./scripts/run_mypy.sh\nNote that we expect mypy to have version 0.760 or higher, and when type checking, use PyTorch 1.4 or\nhigher due to fixes to PyTorch type hints available in 1.4. We also use the Literal feature which is\navailable only in Python 3.8 or above. If type-checking using a previous version of Python, you will\nneed to install the typing-extension package which can be done with pip using pip install typing-extensions.\nUnit Tests\nTo run the unit tests, you can either use pytest (if installed):\nbash\npytest -ra\nor python's unittest:\nbash\npython -m unittest\nTo get coverage reports we recommend using the pytest-cov plugin:\nbash\npytest -ra --cov=. --cov-report term-missing\nDocumentation\nCaptum's website is also open source, and is part of this very repository (the\ncode can be found in the website folder).\nIt is built using Docusaurus, and consists of three\nmain elements:\n\nThe documentation in Docusaurus itself (if you know Markdown, you can\n   already contribute!). This lives in the docs.\nThe API reference, auto-generated from the docstrings using\n   Sphinx, and embedded into the Docusaurus website.\n   The sphinx .rst source files for this live in sphinx/source.\nThe Jupyter notebook tutorials, parsed by nbconvert, and embedded into the\n   Docusaurus website. These live in tutorials.\n\nTo build the documentation you will need Node >= 8.x\nand Yarn >= 1.5.\nThe following command will both build the docs and serve the site locally:\nbash\n./scripts/build_docs.sh\nPull Requests\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from master.\nIf you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.\n   In other words, add unit tests.\nIf you have changed APIs, update the documentation. Make sure the\n   documentation builds.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code passes both black and flake8 formatting checks.\n\nIssues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is\nclear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\nFacebook has a bounty program for the safe\ndisclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process\noutlined on that page and do not file a public issue.\nLicense\nBy contributing to Captum, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.",

If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\n- The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank\n\nIf you want somef to be automatically configured (without GitHUb authentication key and using the default classifiers) just type:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure -a\n```\n\nFor showing help about the available options, run:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure --help\n```\nWhich displays:\n\n```bash\nUsage: somef configure [OPTIONS]\n\n  Configure GitHub credentials and classifiers file path\n\nOptions:\n  -a, --auto  Automatically configure SOMEF\n  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.\n```\n",
