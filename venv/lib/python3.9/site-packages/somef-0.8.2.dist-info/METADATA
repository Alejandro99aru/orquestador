A command line interface for automatically extracting relevant information from readme files.

**Authors:** Daniel Garijo, Allen Mao, Miguel Ángel García Delgado, Haripriya Dharmala, Vedant Diwanji, Jiaying Wang and Aidan Kelley.

## Features
Given a readme file (or a GitHub/Gitlab repository) SOMEF will extract the following categories (if present):

- **Name**: Name identifying a software component
- **Full name**: Name + owner (owner/name)
- **Full title**: If the repository is a short name, we will attempt to extract the longer version of the repository  name
- **Description**: A description of what the software does.
- **Citation**: Preferred citation (usually in `.bib` form) as the authors have stated in their readme file.
- **Installation instructions**: A set of instructions that indicate how to install a target repository
- **Invocation**: Execution command(s) needed to run a scientific software component
- **Usage examples**: Assumptions and considerations recorded by the authors when executing a software component, or examples on how to use it.
- **Documentation**: Where to find additional documentation about a software component.
- **Requirements**: Pre-requisites and dependencies needed to execute a software component.
- **Contributors**: Contributors to a software component
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions about a software component
- **Support**: Guidelines and links of where to obtain support for a software component
- **License**: License and usage terms of a software component
- **Contact**: Contact person responsible for maintaining a software component
- **Download URL**: URL where to download the target software (typically the installer, package or a tarball to a stable version)
- **DOI**: Digital Object Identifier associated with the software (if any)
- **DockerFile**: Build file(s) to create a Docker image for the target software
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks included in a repository
- **Executable notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks ready for execution (e.g., through myBinder)
- **Owner**: Name of the user or organization in charge of the repository
- **Owner type**: Type of the owner, user or organization, of the repository
- **Keywords**: set of terms used to commonly identify a software component
- **Source code**: Link to the source code (typically the repository where the readme can be found)
- **Releases**: Pointer to the available versions of a software component
- **Changelog**: Description of the changes between versions
- **Issue tracker**: Link where to open issues for the target repository
- **Programming languages**: Languages used in the repository
- **Repository Status**: Repository status as it is described in [repostatus.org](https://www.repostatus.org/)
- **Arxiv Links**: Links to Arxiv articles
- **Stargazers count**: Total number of stargazers of the project
- **Forks count**: Number of forks of the project
- **Forks url**: Links to forks made of the project
- **Code of Conduct**: Link to the code of conduct of the project
- **Scripts**: Snippets of code contained in the repository.
- **Support channels**: Help channels one can use to get support about the target software component.
- **Images**: Images used to illustrate the software component.
- **Logo**: Main logo used to represent the target software component.
- **Ontologies**: URL and path to the ontology files present in the repository.


We use different supervised classifiers, header analysis, regular expressions and the GitHub/Gitlab API to retrieve all these fields (more than one technique may be used for each field)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9

SOMEF has been tested on Unix, MacOS and Windows Microsoft operating systems

## Install from Pypi
SOMEF [is available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/). To install it just type:

```
pip install somef
```

## Install from GitHub
To run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:

Clone this GitHub repository

```
git clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git
```

Install somef (you should be in the folder that you just cloned). Note that for Python 3.7 and 3.8 the module Cython should be installed in advanced (through the command: `pip install Cython`).

```
cd somef
pip install -e .
```

Test SOMEF installation

```bash
somef --help
```

If everything goes fine, you should see:

```bash
Usage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  configure  Configure credentials
  describe   Running the Command Line Interface
  version    Show somef version.
```

## Installing through Docker
We provide a Docker image with SOMEF already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:

```bash
docker build -t somef .
```
Or just use the Docker image already built in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcapd/somef):

```bash
docker pull kcapd/somef
```

Then, to run your image just type:

```bash
docker run -it kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```

And you will be ready to use SOMEF (see section below). If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```
If you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.


## Usage

Before running SOMEF for the first time, you must **configure** it appropriately (you only need to do this once). Run

```bash
somef configure
```

And you will be asked to provide the following:

- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
- The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank

If you want somef to be automatically configured (without GitHUb authentication key and using the default classifiers) just type:

```bash
somef configure -a
```

For showing help about the available options, run:

```bash
somef configure --help
```
Which displays:

```bash
Usage: somef configure [OPTIONS]

  Configure GitHub credentials and classifiers file path

Options:
  -a, --auto  Automatically configure SOMEF
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### Updating SOMEF
If you update SOMEF to a newer version, we recommend you `configure` again the library (by running `somef configure`). The rationale is that different versions may rely on classifiers which may be stored in a different path. 

### Run SOMEF

```bash
$ somef describe --help
  SOMEF Command Line Interface
Usage: somef describe [OPTIONS]

  Running the Command Line Interface

Options:
  -t, --threshold FLOAT           Threshold to classify the text  [required]
  Input: [mutually_exclusive, required]
    -r, --repo_url URL            Github/Gitlab Repository URL
    -d, --doc_src PATH            Path to the README file source
    -i, --in_file PATH            A file of newline separated links to GitHub/
                                  Gitlab repositories

  Output: [required_any]
    -o, --output PATH             Path to the output file. If supplied, the
                                  output will be in JSON

    -c, --codemeta_out PATH       Path to an output codemeta file
    -g, --graph_out PATH          Path to the output Knowledge Graph export
                                  file. If supplied, the output will be a
                                  Knowledge Graph, in the format given in the
                                  --format option chosen (turtle, json-ld)

  -f, --graph_format [turtle|json-ld]
                                  If the --graph_out option is given, this is
                                  the format that the graph will be stored in

  -p, --pretty                    Pretty print the JSON output file so that it
                                  is easy to compare to another JSON output
                                  file.

  -m, --missing                   JSON report with the missing metadata fields
                                  SOMEF was not able to find. The report will
                                  be placed in  $PATH_missing.json, where
                                  $PATH is -o, -c or -g.
  -kt, --keep_tmp PATH            SOMEF will NOT delete the temporary folder
                                  where files are stored for analysis. Files
                                  will be stored at the
                                  desired path


  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

## Usage example:
The following command extracts all metadata available from [https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/).

```bash
somef describe -r https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/ -o test.json -t 0.8
```
